    </h1>

    <p>React components with NO STATE.</p>

    <p>Anarchism is a curated collection of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>
        components intended to be used on unidirectional data flow architectures. The
        most well known is probably <a href="http://redux.js.org/">redux</a> (but also other
        <a href="http://facebook.github.io/flux/">flux</a> like implementations); however any
        approach that may benefit from stateless components may be used as well (e.g.
        FRP libraries, GraphQL + <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a>, etc..).</p>

    <p>The library contains two kind of components:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>pure components they are stateless components with no side-effects. They are
            responsible to render the visible part of your application. They are pure
            functions depending on props and context.
        </li>
        <li>impure components they are wrapper or decorator components that are
            responsible to deal with all the behaviors that may not be achieved without
            state or some kind of side effects (e.g. DOM stuff). They are allowed to have
            some state or side effects, but are not allowed to render anything visible, just
            wrap or decorate pure components.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Presentational components should use the minimum set of css properties to define
        their behavior and/or structure, anything else should remain unstyled.</p>

    <p>A "future first" approach is preferred: use newest css and js features relying
        on transpilers and polyfills to maximize compatibility and eventually apply
        specific hacks only when polyfills are failing.</p>

    <p>All the components will also play nicely when rendered on the server (isomorphic
        applications), especially impure components that are dealing with the DOM will
        have fallback solutions when the <code>window</code> object is not available.</p>

        to use it</h2>

    <p>To use anarchism components you just need to install anarchism
        as a dependency in your project:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-bash">npm install --save anarchism
</code></pre>

    <p>then simply import the components you want to use:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-jsx"
>import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import {Zoom} from 'anarchism';

ReactDOM.render(
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;Zoom
            isVisible={true} // show or hide the modal (default to false)
            width=&quot;50%&quot; // width of the modal in css format (default to &quot;100%&quot;)
            height=&quot;50%&quot; // height of the modal in css format (default to &quot;100%&quot;)
            hAlign=&quot;center&quot; // horizontal alignment [&quot;left&quot;, &quot;center&quot;, &quot;right&quot;] (default to &quot;center&quot;)
            vAlign=&quot;center&quot; // vertical alignment [&quot;top&quot;, &quot;center&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;] (default to &quot;center&quot;)
            offset={{ // offset from the current layout position
                x: '-20px' // horizontal offset in css format (default to &quot;0&quot;)
                y: '5%' // vertical offset in css format (default to &quot;0&quot;)
            }}
            zIndex={99} // zIndex for the modal (default to 1)
            overlay={someNode} // jsx node element to create a background overlay
        &gt;

            ... // content of the modal

        &lt;/Zoom&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;,
    document.getElementById('zoom-example')
);</code></pre>

    <p>Click <button id="example-zoom-button">The Button</button> to see how it looks with some minimal user styling.</p>

    <div id="example-zoom"></div>

    <h2>
        <a id="what-it-is-not" class="anchor" href="#what-it-is-not" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true"
                                                                                              class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What
        it is not</h2>

    <p>This project do not want to provide ready to use components
        with a common design. You will not find the typical front-end elements you can
        expect from common frameworks such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a>,
        <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">foundation</a>,
        <a href="http://www.material-ui.com/">material-ui</a>, etc...</p>

    <p>While those libraries are great for prototyping, you will always end up wanting
        to deeply change their style and behavior on real world projects. Given their
        complex nature, very often the effort to adapt them to our own necessities is
        higher than writing from scratch a bunch of components.</p>

    <p>Also, as far as we know, none of the well known front-end libraries are optimized
        to be used with unidirectional data flows and very often they rely heavily on
        state and DOM events and manipulations.</p>

    <p>The only stateless react components library know to us so far is
        <a href="http://jxnblk.com/rebass/">Rebass</a>, a really nice project that should work very
        well for prototyping flux based applications. However it comes with its own
        style that you can eventually configure (on some of its aspects) using context
        properties or overwrite when needed. In a real project you will probably end up
        anyway spending more time overriding stuff than actually composing your
        application.</p>

        <a id="why-we-need-anarchism" class="anchor" href="#why-we-need-anarchism" aria-hidden="true"><span
                aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why we need anarchism</h2>

    <p>This is an ongoing project where we want to collect
        components that respect the above rules. Ideally every component should be as
        much minimalistic and abstract as possible and you should not feel the needs to
        change it or to not being using all of its features.</p>

    <p>Sometimes we end up implementing again and again the same behavioral pattern for
        lot of front-end components. A very basic example may be show different contents
        on a div depending on props, or more complex things like a full-blown stateless
        slider with no interface or any other styling than the very strictly needed for
        layout and animation.</p>

    <p>This library want to abstract these patterns and its expected usage on real
        world project would be to create complete and styled front-end components that
        use anarchism components as dependencies to implement their behavior.</p>

        to contribute?</h2>

    <p>There are at least 4 ways to contribute to the project:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Adding very simple components that abstract some basic pattern directly inside
            this repository
        </li>
        <li>Open an issue to propose an external project (available on npm) that may fit
            inside the library
        </li>
        <li>bug fixing, testing and cross-browser issues solving are always welcome</li>
        <li>contribute to the example folder with interesting components created using
            anarchism
        </li>
    </ul>
